he never specified why.

After years and years of tiring lectures, tutorials, presentations, seminars on psychology

decided to retire. Before leaving, he handed his lecture notes to his favourite students
and also a last message informing them of a clue to the secret behind his 24x7 good mood despite the bad food

But, the students are puzzled about deciphering the notes, which were all in Russian.
More importantly, they needed the clue to the secret. Luckily, the students found a hint
in the Professor's cabin. A single image reminding him of something he often forgot.

Can you help them decipher what the professor meant to reveal?

Being in an engineering institute of high repute, they need your help in classifying those unlabeled bottles.

Refer to the highly simplified neural network (a single neuron, in fact) in the resources. This network is in the middle of an epoch. As you know, Gradient Descent is a very popular backpropagation algorithm that is used to minimize the loss function, which involves calculating gradients.

Here X1 denotes the amount of lemon extract and X2 denotes the amount of orange extract.  A prediction of 0 means the bottle contains Nimbooz while 1 means Minute Maid.

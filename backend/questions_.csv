"Meet Deadpool
","👋 Hey, you! Yeah, you reading this. Guess what? You’ve just summoned the one and only Deadpool🦸‍♂️🔴💢⚔ —because clearly, this event needed a little more me in it. 😏⚔️

Don’t worry, I’ll keep it classy. Or not. (Spoiler: definitely not.) 😈 So, buckle up, buttercup, because I’m about to break more than just the fourth wall. 🧱🔨

Alrighty then, buckle up, buttercup, because I’m your tour guide for this crazy CTF ride! 🎢 And you? Well, you’re my sidekick in crime—nah, just kidding.

Let’s kick things off super easy. This is a CTF (Capture The Flag), and just so you know what you’re hunting for, here’s how the flag will look: CODE{bye_By3_bye}. 🏴‍☠️

Btw, Wolverine hates that song, by the way. Trust me, I made him listen to it on repeat. 🎶🐺",,,10,CODE{bye_By3_bye},0
Sanity Check ,"Now, let’s get to the important stuff. I know what you’re all wondering—how are we gonna do this without dishonoring the Deadpool Legacy or Logan’s memory? 🤔 Spoiler alert: We’re not. My Legacy is unruinable but I’m here to dig his grave and find him 🪦 while you should be busy finding flags, but here you are, reading about me yapping. 📖🗣️

Now go forth, my brave little minions, and unearth those Loganic flags hidden deep within the Discord channels, while I, your fearless leader, dig up Wolverine’s grave. ⚔️

Oh, and if you haven’t joined the Discord channel yet—what are you even doing with your life? Just kidding! Don’t shoot yourself in the head (leave the self-destructive tendencies to me). Here’s the link instead: Discord Channel Link 💥

Oh, and one last hint for you, kiddos: the key to finding this flag? Well, it’s hidden where all the best things are—in pure insanity! 😈",,"Hell yeah, I'm insane",10,CODE{1m_1ns8n3},0
"What does Deadpool say 
","🧨 So yeah, the TVA decided to crash my little mission, and let me tell you—it was a bloodbath. Like, Quentin Tarantino would’ve been proud. 🩸🎥 And trust me, this wasn’t my choice. I didn’t wake up thinking, ‘Hey, you know what I’d love today? A bureaucratic beatdown.’ 💼🥊

Well, let me explain. Life’s been a bit of a snoozefest lately. 😴 I mean, I was losing interest faster than you can run. Couldn’t figure out who I was anymore. 😵‍💫 My girlfriend called me a narcissist (ouch) 💔 and left me. I failed the Avengers audition—turns out, they don’t appreciate my unique skill set—and now I’m just a washed-up car salesman. 🚗😢 Yup, that’s me: Deadpool, dealer of slightly used minivans and shattered dreams.

And finally, one fine day—obviously my birthday, because the universe revolves around me 🎂✨—all the people I care about were gathered. And by ‘people,’ I mean, like, my katana Bea and... yeah, that’s pretty much it. 🗡️💔 But hey, you can just Google my life story. The internet’s basically my biographer at this point. 🕵️‍♂️💻

Then, out of nowhere, the TVA decides to crash my party. 🎉🚨 And holy chimichangas, I thought they were here to spice things up! 🌶️ But nope, they threw me into custody, yapping about how they were gonna destroy my universe. 🌌💥 And guess who was leading the charge? That paradoxical buzzkill himself—Mr. Paradox. 🤯

Honestly, why am I even explaining this to you? Go watch the damn movie. 🎬🍿 But you’re probably tired of hearing me yap by now. I know you’re just here for the flag, but guess what, cupcake? It ain’t that easy. 🎯🚫

👉 I need to know that you really know me and love me. So, TELL ME—what do I always SAY when I’m DTF (Down to Fight)? Nail it, and I’ll toss you that flag. 🎌💪",,Just read the last paragraph thats it.,10,CODE{mAx1mum_E66Ort},0
Digging the Grave,"💥 Alright, you’re probably wondering, ‘Why is the red-faced merc yapping so much?’ 🤔 Well, excuse me for trying to keep things concise! If you actually watched my movie 🎬, you’d know I’m all about that tight, focused storytelling. 🎯

🧘‍♂️ Okay, Deadpool, deep breaths… focus. Here’s the deal: I’m gonna loop things around here. 🔄 In question 1️⃣, I told you how I’m on this epic quest to find Logan 🐺 and how you need to hunt down those precious flags 🏴. Then, in question 2️⃣, I gave you the juicy backstory of how I got to question 1️⃣. See? Full circle, baby! 🔄💪

But now, it’s time to get serious. 😤 I’ve got to track down Logan in at least one of the multiverses 🌌 and drag his clawed, grumpy butt 🦸‍♂️ back to my universe because apparently, he’s some kind of ‘anchor being’ ⚓ and the only hope for saving this world. 🌍 Desperate times, folks. I mean, sure, I’m Marvel Jesus ✝️ and all, but even I need a little help from the furball. 🐾

So here’s the plan: I’ll go on a multiverse scavenger hunt 🔍 for Logan, and you, my little sidekick 🦸‍♀️, need to find the ‘Loganic’ flag 🏴 hidden somewhere in the starred github repo's. And c’mon, does Wolverine really need an intro? He’s the yellow-suited, cigar-chomping, sexy beast 🧑‍🔧 you all know and love. And we need him.

😲 You’re probably like, “WTF (Wolverine The Fire)? How are my starred repos the same as everyone else’s?” Well, buckle up, because I’ve got the answer. 🕵️‍♂️

Simple, my friend. 🤓 Just take this nifty little script (think of it like that time machine thingy I borrowed—okay, stole—from the TVA) and run it with your GitHub token as input. 🕰️🔑 And voilà, it’ll star a few repos for you. Now, here’s the fun part: you need to dig through those starred repos to find the flag. 🏴‍☠️

Since this is level zero, I’m feeling generous. 🎁 Here’s a doc link that’ll walk you through how to run this bad boy. 📜🖥️

Oh, and one more thing, lucky baby boy—if each of your team members runs this script individually(like all your team members), you might just score some cool stickers. 🎉🔥",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VtuOQRMaozNIAgPsCH7IVSK7NYJpPwKoeHYVF990rc4/edit?usp=sharing,,10,CODE{t93_r16HT_w0lv3r1n3},0

Theseus In The Maze,"Ah, so you wanna play hero, huh? 🦸‍♂️ Well, let me introduce you to Theseus, the original Greek badass! 🇬🇷 This dude took on the Minotaur—a freaky creature with the head of a bull 🐂 and the body of a man 🧔. Yeah, sounds like a nightmare mashup you'd see in a bad horror movie. 🎥

So, here's the juicy backstory: The Kingdom of Crete was all like, ""Yo, Athens, gimme that annual tribute, or else!"" 👑💰 And what did they do with it? Fed it to this man-bull thing trapped in a giant maze, because why not? 🌀 People who went in? Never came out. Remind you of a certain bird-mimicking archer with some PTSD? 🦅😬

Today, my friend, YOU get to be Theseus! 🎭 You’ll find the quickest way out of this crazy maze, dodging that bull-headed psycho (because let’s face it, you’re only pretending to be him—no way you’re actually slaying that maniac 😅).

You’ve got two files to help you out. question.py is where you’ll write your oh-so-brilliant Python algorithm 🧠🐍 to escape. And test.py? That’s where the maze awaits.

Here's the deal: 'S' is where you start 🚀, 'E' is the exit 🏁, '.' is a path you can walk on 🚶‍♂️, and '#' means, ""Nope, blocked! 🚧"" You can move in four directions—up, down, left, right. Easy, right? 😎

Oh, and for those of you who don’t speak Python 🐍, don’t run away just yet! Adriane, the King’s daughter 👸, gave Theseus a little “hack”—a ball of string to track his path. 🧶 So yeah, even ancient Greek heroes used cheat codes. 😉",https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QsfMLXKwo1yOAnlIPHue7bI1Sm-jXZ0r?usp=sharing ,,15,CODE{146},1

Turns out, it’s the instructions for the legendary Coded Breathing Technique—a super-secret, super-powerful move that makes demons cry for their mommies. But, of course, it’s locked behind a cipher that’s tougher than Wolverine’s attitude on a Monday. The text is encrypted using an intricate transposition cipher known for its ability to conceal messages within a seemingly random arrangement of letters.It is enshrouded in complex encryption, an elaborate lattice that distorts the message into an enigmatic sequence of letters.

Measure Similarity,"Professor Deadpool, the unpredictable and quirky headmaster of the Merc with a Mouth Academy, is absolutely fed up with his students copying each other's essays. He's laid down some strict anti-plagiarism rules, and he's not messing around. The students have been tasked with writing essays on their favorite topics, but Deadpool knows these little mercenaries-in-training are sneaky and might try to plagiarize just parts of each other’s work.

To catch these sneaky students, Deadpool has come up with a diabolical formula to calculate the ""Similarity"" between two strings 'A' and 'B'. It’s defined as follows:

Similarity(A,B) = 6×LCS(A,B) − 2×∣A∣−∣B∣

where:
  - LCS(A, B) is the Longest Common Subsequence between strings A and B.
  - |A| is the length of string A, and |B| is the length of string B.  


Because Deadpool always thinking three steps ahead (and loves a good challenge), he knows these students might not copy entire essays. Instead, they might only copy parts of each other’s work. So Deadpool wants you to calculate the maximum similarity for any pairs of substrings between two given strings A and B

Your mission, should you choose to accept it (and you better, unless you want Deadpool to break the fourth wall and come after you), is to find the maximum similarity score over all possible pairs of substrings (A', B'), where A' and B' are substrings of A and B, respectively.

Each town, with its unique character, holds the promise of profit, but reaching these towns comes at a cost.

There exist 𝑁 towns—Libertyville, Springfield, Oakdale, Brooksville, and Rivertown, among others. The cost to travel between them is steep, calculated by a fixed rate of 𝐶 dollars per unit distance. The towns are all arranged in a straight line - the distance between the ith and jth towns is j - i units, where j > i. With each of the M markets offering a specific profit, Ethan must decide carefully which markets to attend to maximize his earnings, especially since every toll he pays chips away at his potential profit.

Each market i is described by a pair of integers (Ti,Pi), where Ti is the  hosting town and Pi is the potential profit from that town. Markets are scheduled sequentially so the ith market concludes before the (i+1)th market, and Ethan can move at the speed of light so time of travel is redundant.

Ethan emarks on his jounrney with an inital capital of 10^(100^100). His objective is to maximise the profits, you have to help him do so. The flag is the maximum profit you can earn from the given markets. eg; if initial capital + X is amount Ethan earned then the flag is X.

Cracking the Core,"As Wade and Logan prepare to disrupt the Time Ripper, they encounter an impenetrable encryption device designed by Cassandra Nova to protect the core of the device, which works by capturing images of it's user. This encryption is based on Self-Attention mechanism, originally conceived for sequence modeling and is part of the Transformer architecture in the paper “Attention is All You Need”, but now is adapted to Convolutional NNs as proposed in the paper here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08318 (Pay attention to Figure 2 and Section 3).

To crack the encryption, Wade and Logan need to calculate specific parameter shapes of the Self-Attention network. The encryption is fed with an input image of shape (1, 64, 64, 64), that is, the number of channels, width and height are all 64 with a batch size of 1. Wade knows that to crack the code, they must determine:

-- Q: The output shape of the query convolution step.
-- K: The shape of the RESHAPED output of the key convolution step (after reshaping).
-- V: The output shape of the value convolution step.
-- O: The shape of the final output of the Self-Attention layer.

Once Wade and Logan figure out these shapes, they need to calculate the encryption key to the core using the formula:

[ (3 * Q[1] * K[2] * V[3]) / (O[1] + O[2] + O[3]) ]

Can you help Wade and Logan crack the code by finding the correct integer value of the encryption key?

Important note: Self Attention in CNNs can have many variations. For this question, please keep in mind the following:

  - IGNORE the last 1x1 convolution just before the output.
  - Do NOT reshape the input before calculating Q,V and K. Reshape accordingly just after.

The potato, now  a multidimensional object, is more elusive than ever—and its recovery is critical to winning the final battle against Paradox.

Raphson, desperate and out of options, calls on Newton once more. But this time, its different. In this bizarre, multidimensional reality, finding the exact location of the super potato is nearly impossible. Instead, they must pinpoint the most likely—or least likely—location.

The probability that the potato is at any given location is dictated by a strange equation, link to which is given below.

The Web of Destiny,"As Wade and Logan face the final confrontation against Cassandra Nova, they find themselves trapped in a dimension known as the Web of Destiny, a place where reality itself is woven together by intricate, invisible threads. The only way to break free and confront Cassandra is to unravel the web, which has ensnared their path forward.

This dimension is represented as a weighted, undirected graph G with N nodes, each corresponding to a point of destiny. Initially, these nodes are disconnected, but with each move, the web becomes more complex as new threads—symbolizing connections between the nodes—are added.

We perform M operations to add these threads to the Web of Destiny. In the i-th operation (1≤i≤M), you are given a subset of destiny points Si = {Ai1, Ai2, ...., Aik} consisting of Ki points. For every pair of points u and v within this subset, a thread with weight Ci is added between them.

After all M operations, the web will be fully formed, representing the intricate connections that bind their fate. However, the only way to break free is to find the lightest path—a minimum spanning tree—that will sever the web’s hold on them.

Your task is to calculate the total weight of this minimum spanning tree, which will free Wade and Logan from the Web of Destiny, allowing them to finally face Cassandra Nova and decide the fate of the multiverse.

The first line in the test case contains the values of N and M respectively. The next M pairs of lines correspond to the M operations to be performed, where the first line of each pair contains the Ki and Ci values of that operation, and the second line contains Ki values corresponding to the node values Ai1, Ai2, ..., Aik of that operation.
